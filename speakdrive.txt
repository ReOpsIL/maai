SpeakDrive – English Conversation Chatbot

**Android application**

Description:

SpeakDrive is your personal English-speaking coach on the go — designed especially for safe use while driving. The app helps you improve your spoken English by engaging you in dynamic, subject-focused conversations without overwhelming stories or long lectures.

When you launch the app, it gives you a random list of 5 conversation topics. Just say or tap the number of the topic you want to discuss, and the chatbot will start asking short, focused questions to encourage you to speak. Instead of telling you long stories, SpeakDrive keeps the conversation active and user-centered by prompting short sentences and quick responses to keep you talking — and thinking — in English.

Key Features:

🎙️ Hands-free voice interaction (ideal for driving)

🎯 5-topic random list on every start to keep it fresh

❓ Conversational focus with short questions and prompts

💬 No lectures or monologues — just real speaking practice

🚗 Designed with drivers in mind — minimal distraction

Whether you're commuting or on a road trip, SpeakDrive keeps your mind engaged and your English growing.
