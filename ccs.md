## Performance Standards:

No performance standards have been established for such device under Section 514 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

## Intended Use/Indication for Use:

The HealthCCSng device is intended for use as a non-invasive post-processing software to evaluate calcified plaques in the coronary arteries, which present a risk for coronary artery disease.
The HealthCCSng device analyzes routine non-gated, non-contrast CT studies that include the entire heart of adult patients of age 30-85.
The device generates an exact calcium score and a four coronary artery calcium detection category output representing the estimated quantity of calcium detected together with preview axial images of the detected calcium meant for informational purposes only.
The device output will be available to the radiologist as part of their standard workflow. A list of studies that received a successful algorithm analysis result will also be available for further clinician assessment (such as by a cardiologist, general practitioner etc.).
The HealthCCSng results are not intended to be used on a stand-alone basis for risk attribution, clinical decision-making or otherwise preclude clinical assessment of CT studies.

## Device Description:

HealthCCSng product is a software device that automatically estimates the coronary artery calcium category from non-cardiac-gated adult CT scans. The product is aimed to leverage the high utilization of CT scans in the medical care environment (both inpatient and outpatient), including lung cancer screening programs, in order to automatically detect calcification in the coronary arteries of patients in an opportunistic manner.

The HealthCCSng product analyzes cases using an artificial intelligence algorithm for the automated detection and estimation of coronary calcium and outputs a result for review by the clinician. The device works in parallel to and in conjunction with the standard of care workflow. The final diagnosis is made by the clinician after reviewing the scan independently of the software. The device is intended for use by the clinicians as a non-diagnostic analysis software in conjunction with additional patient information and professional judgment.

HealthCCSng receives a non-gated, non-contrast CT study from the storage application, Nanox Al's Imaging Analytics Platform (IMA)/ other platforms. For each CT study received, the software shall validate at least one compliant series in which the entire heart is present and performs an analysis. For each complaint study, the software shall output:

1.  Estimated Coronary Calcium Detection, based on the measurement of calcium deposits in the coronary arteries.
2.  A corresponding Estimated Coronary Calcium Detection Category, based on the Estimated Coronary Calcium measurements.

## Product Output:

The software output will include the following calcium categories:

| Estimated Coronary Calcium Detection | Corresponding Estimated Coronary Calcium Detection Category |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0                                  | Zero Calcium                                            |
| 1-99                               | Low                                                     |
| 100-399                            | Medium                                                  |
| ≥400                               | High                                                    |

For patients in which calcium was detected, the user will be presented with representative key images - all the slices containing the measured coronary calcifications (130 HU and above). On these images, the calcified areas will be annotated.

The following modules compose the HealthCCSng software:

1.  **Data input and validation:** DICOM validation receives imaging study from hosting application and the validation feature assessed the input data (i.e. age, modality, view, etc.) to ensure compatibility for processing by the algorithm.
2.  **HealthCCSng algorithm:** Once a study has been validated, the algorithm analyzes the CT for analysis and quantification.
3.  **IMA Integration feature:** The results of a successful study analysis are provided to the hosting application.
4.  **Error codes feature:** In the case of a study failure during data validation or the analysis by the algorithm, an error is provided to the system.

The product operates in the following manner:

1.  A CT scan is sent to the Image Analytics Platform (IMA).
2.  The Image Analytics Platform (IMA) forwards the scan to the HealthCCSng algorithm for analysis.
3.  The scan is analyzed, with the following possible results sent back to IMA:

a.  **Non-compliant:** the scan is not compliant with the input criteria of the product and is therefore not analyzed.
b.  **Success -**
    1.  Success - A Zero calcium, Low, Medium or High Coronary Calcium Detection has been identified.
    2.  Success No Category - Cause: metal artifact(s) suggestive of known cardiac disease is suspected.
c.  **Failure:** the scan has been analyzed. An error prevented the device from completing the analysis and therefore there is no output available.

In all cases of success, HealthCCSng will provide key images of visualization of the detected coronary calcium (except for zero category), the category name and the exact score.

## Technological Characteristics Compared to Cleared Device:

We believe that the HealthCCSng modified device is substantially equivalent to the Nano-X AI HealthCCSng cleared device K210085.

## Performance Data:

The HealthCCSng was designed and manufactured under the Quality System Regulations as outlined in 21 CFR § 820.
Safety and performance of HealthCCSng has been evaluated and verified in accordance with software specifications and applicable performance standards through Software Development and Validation & Verification Process to ensure performance according to specifications, User Requirements and Federal Regulations and Guidance documents, “Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices".

The HealthCCSng modified device performance was evaluated in a retrospective, simulated use, standalone performance study of its performance compared to the established ground truth and relative to the cleared device. The ground truth (Coronary Artery Calcium Category) was determined by the majority agreement of two out of three US board certified radiologists, experienced in identifying coronary calcium on non-gated CT studies.

The validation dataset included a truthed and enriched sample of at least 400 anonymized CT scans that include the heart from 4 healthcare institutions: Intermountain Healthcare (US), Clalit Health System (OUS), Northewell Health (US) and USARAD (US). The sample was engineered to contain sufficient cases within all coronary artery calcium categories.

The validation dataset included 436 cases, of which the algorithm returned a result on 427 cases, a yield of 97.94% (30-85 years old;mean age of 61.89 years; SD=13.11; male=58.31% (249)). The validation dataset represented the following imaging parameters: Modality (CT), Slice Thickness (0.5, 0.6, 0.625, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.75, 4, and 5 mm), Slice Increment (0.625, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 mm), Exposure in mAs (Radiation Dose) i(15-966), KVP (100, 120, 130, 135 and 140), and four (4) manufacturers of CT devices (GE, Philips, Siemens and Toshiba). CT data across all, slice thickness, slice increment, exposure, KVP and manufacturers were well supported by the HealthCCSng device.

The HealthCCSng device demonstrated an overall agreement between HealthCCSng coronary calcium category and the ground truth category of 89.46% (95% CI: [86.15%, 92.21%]). The lower bound of the confidence interval for the primary endpoint of overall agreement is greater than the success criterion of 85%, thus the null hypothesis is rejected, and the acceptance criterion met.

*   Agreement for the **Zero category** was: 86.63% (95% CI: [80.61%, 91.33]), the point estimate for the Zero category is greater than 85%, the acceptance criterion is met.
*   Agreement for the **Low category** was: 87.65% (95% CI: [78.47%, 93.92%]), the point estimate for the Low category is greater than 85%, the acceptance criterion is met.
*   Agreement for the **Medium category** was: 87.36% (95% CI: [78.50%, 93.52%]), the point estimate limit for the Medium category is greater than 76%, the acceptance criterion is met.
*   Agreement for the **High category** was: 98.85% (95% CI: [93.76%, 99.97%]), the point estimate for the High category is greater than 60%, the acceptance criterion is met.

The HealthCCSng estimated coronary calcium score was compared to the corresponding ground truth (GT) score.
The HealthCCSng device demonstrated a statistically significant correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient) between the GT and HealthCCSng scores of r=0.959 (95% CI: [0.9499, 0.9655], p<0.0001.

The device validation also demonstrated good correlation between the algorithm results on paired non-gated and gated scans, as summarized in table 1 and figures 1-2 below.

In addition, the device performed as well as radiologists did, however the user should note that Coronary Calcium Scoring on non-gated CT scans, is not as accurate as on gated CT scans.
